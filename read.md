this is a calender application that you can add events(schedule) too.

I understand monolith coding isn't favorable, my goal with this project was to get better with DOM manipulation, fortunetly got to learn more about utilizing json to create objects for the events and pushing them to the calender.

my biggest challenge on this was figuring out how to stringify the local data and understanding json and what it can do.

I may come back to this project once i finish my course with react to make it look prettier.
